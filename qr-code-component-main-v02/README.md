### What I learned

I recently resumed writing front-end applications after a long break.  However, I've started using Figma files this time, and it offered me a clear grasp of how to space out the parts I need to give.  I've learned how to examine elements, understand the distance between various elements, and recognize typical style variations, also text properties lot simpler.

### Continued development

I want to improve my front-end application development and learn more about Figma's features.

### Useful resources

- [Figma For Developers](https://www.frontendmentor.io/articles/figma-for-developers-how-to-work-with-a-design-file-m6CZKZ1rC1) - This helped me for understanding the basics of Figma. I really liked the way explained in this article by Frontend Mentor.
